Today, once again, my environment start throwing that SSL cert error.

I followed the basics of the [commom link](http://railsapps.github.io/openssl-certificate-verify-failed.html),
bit it didn't solve the issue. So, I came across
[this blog post](http://blog.digitalpierce.com/2013/11/28/gem-install-unable-to-download-data/)
which solve my problem. I just did:

{% highlight bash %}
brew update
brew install openssl
brew link openssl --force
brew install curl-ca-bundle
# this next line makes the difference for me!
export SSL_CERT_FILE=/usr/local/opt/curl-ca-bundle/share/ca-bundle.crt
{% endhighlight %}

And now it seems to be working again.

I'll just leave this here, in case anyone ran through the same issue.
