People suddenly start something that looks pretty much like a war.
Generation X people saying that generation Y people heve too much hurry, that
doesn't know how to do anything and other insults, while the Y's says that the
X's are too much slow, can't follow the technology evolution and etc.

I think there is basically two ignored facts here:

- The Y's were raised by the X's, so, the Y's are basically what the X's
needed and/or what the current environment need, environment that has been
molded by the X's;
- Wanting or not, Y's will take the place of the X's. At the same time
the next generation will start to take the place of the Y's. That’s just
the nature. People get old and die while children are born and grown.

The other day I was chatting with my boss, a X, exactly about this
subject, due to a post we saw at Facebook. We both agreed that this kind
of fight between generations is totally unnecessary. The generations aren't
better or worse, just different.

So, why are people trying to fight against that?

The new generations are, in fact, less patient with almost everything.
They don't really like all this hierarchical thing as well. They don't
really give a damn about how many years someone works at the same company -
pretty much because it don't necessarily means that they are doing a good
job all those years. In fact, they like and prefer the meritocracy system.

That doesn't make one generation better or worse. I see
the meritocracy thing as something good: people will try to work hard, try to
deserve what they want. The hurry could be good to: if they believe that
they could be better doing something else, or in other company, they will
just quit.

In the other hand, be loyal to a company leads to more trust. Be patient
could also leads to less stress (I guess).

In that post on Facebook, I saw a comment from a X guy, saying that the Y's
can't even replace a lamp, that they can't do anything without a computer
and/or smartphone. I don't really know who from the Y's this guy knew,
but his assumptions are bullshit.

What I commented with my boss and at that Facebook post is that the X’s
seems to feel fear. Fear from being replaced. Fear to not be the better
or the smarter person in the room. Fear to became old.

The thing is: don't matter how many fear you feel, nature will do its job,
you and I will die sooner or later and the next generations will rule the
world. Stop fighting it.
